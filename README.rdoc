== Chris Elliott Code Samples

=== habitrak 
# My first Rails app. A simple multi-user habit tracker. Concept, Design and Code. http://www.habitrakapp.com

=== lottreps 
# A rails site for an artist representative. Front-end and custom CMS. http://www.lottreps.com

=== orderviewer 
# An internal rails site to view orders. There is a process cron that searches S3 for new orders, downloads images, processes images and pulls updates from an API. Client: http://www.makrplace.com

=== Makr_OrderProcessServer 
# A ruby script that monitors an API looking for new orders. Processes new orders, copies files to S3 and to ftp site, sends notification emails and updates the API. Also monitors a gmail account for order updates from the printer and updates the API and sends notifications accordingly. Basically, the printer didn't have an API so they needed a way to process/update orders. Client: http://www.makrplace.com
